## Key Components and Features:
Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
I utilized Terraform, an IaC tool, to define and provision the AWS resources required for my static website hosting solution. This allows for version-controlled, repeatable infrastructure deployments.

## AWS S3 Bucket:
I created an S3 bucket to store and serve the static website files. This bucket is configured for website hosting, allowing for easy content delivery.

## Content Upload and Management:
I provided instructions and scripts for uploading and managing my website content within the S3 bucket.

## Prerequisites:
Basic knowledge of AWS services and concepts.
Familiarity with Terraform and infrastructure as code principles.
An AWS account with appropriate permissions.
An IDE of your Choice, I would suggest VS Code Editor.
This project serves as an excellent foundation for hosting various types of static websites, including personal blogs, portfolio sites, or small business websites.
